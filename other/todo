1. add more to the timeline. thumbnails of frames? done

2. set frame rate in timeline. done

3. move color/pen adjust to left side of main window content?

4. support for tablets!!
   - basic support done (at least for drawing)
   - need to make buttons pressable by pen/stylus
   - add pressure sensitivity (change pen width based on pressure)
   => sort of done / buggy

5. toggle opacity level for onion skin? (and toggle onion skin on/off)

6. drawing with a stylus isn't that smooth at times - i.e. when pressing down
   with the stylus a white circle/icon thingy appears (maybe a property of the tablet/stylus
   software that I don't quite understand right now). this causes lag and I can't see what I've drawn
   until I move the stylus. Not sure if there's anything I can do about it but would be good to research.

7. layers for ScribbleArea? i.e. if I want to have a background and to draw some characters with that background,
   it would be good to keep them as separate layers and collate them into a single image when saving.

8. make animate button in the timeline responsive to tabletevents.
