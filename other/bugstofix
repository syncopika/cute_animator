1. clear screen option in menu only clears the very first frame. so when you're on a different frame and you expect to clear that one, it doesn't happen.
    - decided to make a button to clear current screen instead
2. saving an image gives a black background (due to transparency). not really a bug then, but what if I want a white background?
