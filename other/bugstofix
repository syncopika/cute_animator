1. clear screen option in menu only clears the very first frame. so when you're on a different frame and you expect to clear that one, it doesn't happen.
    - decided to make a button to clear current screen instead

2. saving an image gives a black background (due to transparency). not really a bug then, but what if I want a white background? (change transparency when saving images?)
    - changed transparent pixels to be white when saving images.

3. not sure a bug, but how to cleanly remove focus on textbox after clicking on it without having to draw on the canvas again to shift focus?
   I want to easily regain control over the arrow keys to traverse frames after changing frame rate, if that makes sense.

4. Double-clicking occuring when clicking on buttons with tablet pen

5. Drawing with tablet pen seems to join certain segments of a continuous stroke. maybe there's something going on with recording the last point drawn?
